# ![Ferno ðŸ”¥](https://github.com/vapor-community/firebase-provider/blob/main/screenshots/FERNO.png)

Ferno allows you to easily connect your Vapor project with your Firebase realtime database. It is built with the brand new Vapor 4. It gives you a nice and clean interface to interact with the Firebase Realtime REST API. It will automatically turn the response into your class/struct! 

### Prerequisites
You will need:
- Vapor 4.8+

### Installing

In your Package.swift file, add the line

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/ferno.git", from: "0.6.0")
```

Also make sure you add `Ferno` as a dependency

```swift
dependencies: [
  .product(name: "Ferno", package: "ferno")
]
```

## Setup

### Legacy setup

1. Ferno uses an access token to read and write to your database. First we will need to get your service account information.

    * Log into the Firebase console
    * Click the settings gear next to `Project Overview`
    * Select `Project settings`
    * Select the `SERVICE ACCOUNTS` tab
    * Click the button at the bottom that says `GENERATE NEW PRIVATE KEY`
    * This will download a `.json` file. You will now have access to the email and private key. You will pass those into the initialize during the next step.

2. Register `Ferno` as a Provider and import `Ferno`. This is usually done in `configure.swift`

### FirebaseSDK setup

  1. Log into the Firebase console
  2. Click the settings gear next to `Project Overview`
  3. Select `Project settings`
  4. Select the `SERVICE ACCOUNTS` tab
  5. Select `Firebase Admin SDK` option
  6. Click the button `Generate new private key` to download the json file.

### Ferno setup

You can use the content of json file information to fill out the `FernoDefaultConfiguration` or use the json file to preper the `FernoServiceJsonConfiguration`.

```swift
import Ferno

let fernoConfiguration = FernoDefaultConfiguration(
    basePath: "database-url", 
    email: "service-account-email", 
    privateKey: "private-key"
)
app.ferno.use(.default(fernoConfiguration))
```

If you prefer to use the Firebase `ServiceAccount.json` follow the example below.

```swift
import Ferno

// option 1
let fernoConfiguration = try FernoServiceJsonConfiguration(json: Data)

// option 2
let fernoConfiguration = try FernoServiceJsonConfiguration(path: URL)

// option 3
let fernoConfiguration = FernoServiceJsonConfiguration(
                type: String,
                projectId: String,
                privateKeyId: String,
                privateKey: String,
                clientEmail: String,
                clientId: String,
                authUri: String,
                tokenUri: String,
                authProviderX509CertUrl: String,
                clientX509CertUrl: String,
                universeDomain: String
)

app.ferno.use(.serviceAccountKey(fernoConfiguration))
```

## Parameters

There are some custom parameters to pass into functions. I want to go over all the parameters you will need to know.

### [FernoQuery]

In GET requests, you might want to query on your data. This is what `[FernoQuery]` is for.

`FernoQuery` is an enum with:

   1. `case shallow(Bool)`
   2. `case orderBy(FernoValue)`
   3. `case limitToFirst(FernoValue)`
   4. `case limitToLast(FernoValue)`
   5. `case startAt(FernoValue)`
   6. `case endAt(FernoValue)`
   7. `case equalTo(FernoValue)`

These are all the possible queries that are allowed on Firebase according to the [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/database/#section-query-parameters)

#### NOTES on [FernoQuery]

-  `shallow(Bool)` cannot be mixed with any other query parameters.
- you usually use `orderBy(FernoValue)` in conjunction with enums `3-7`
- using `orderBy(FernoValue)` alone will just order the data returned

#### FernoValue

You will notice most cases in `FernoQuery` have a value of `FernoValue`.
`FernoValue` is just a wrapper for `Bool, String, Int, Double, Float`. So you can just do `.startAt(5)` and everything will work.

#### Examples of [FernoQuery]

Just using shallow:

```swift
[.shallow(true)]
```

Filter data to only return data that matches `"age": 21`:

```swift
[.orderBy("age"), .equalTo(21)]
```

Just orderBy(returns data in ascending order):

```swift
[.orderBy("age")]
```

## Usage

There are 6 functions that allow you to interact with your Firebase realtime database.

### GET

There are four functions that allow you get your data.

```swift
app.ferno.retrieve(_ path: [String], queryItems: [FernoQuery] = [])
```

```swift
app.ferno.retrieve(_ path: String..., queryItems: [FernoQuery] = [])
```

```swift
app.ferno.retrieveMany(_ path: [String], queryItems: [FernoQuery] = [])
```

```swift
app.ferno.retrieveMany(_ path: String..., queryItems: [FernoQuery] = [])
```

The only difference between `retrieve` and `retrieveMany` is the return type.

- `retrieve` returns -> `F` where `F` is of type `Decodable`
- `retrieveMany` returns -> `[String: F]` where `F` is of type `Decodable` and `String` is the key

#### Example

1. Define the value you want the data converted.

```swift
struct Developer: Content {
   var name: String
   var favLanguage: String
   var age: Int
}
```

2. Make the request. Make sure you set the type of the response so Ferno knows what to convert.

```swift
let developers: [String: Developer] = try await app.ferno.retrieveMany("developers")
let developer: Developer = try await app.ferno.retrieve(["developers", "dev1"])
```

### POST

Used to create a new entry in your database

```swift
app.ferno.create(_ path: [String], body: T) try await -> FernoChild
```

```swift
app.ferno.create(_ path: String..., body: T) try await -> FernoChild
```

- `body: T` is of type `Content`.
- `FernoChild` is a struct:

```swift
struct FernoChild: Content {
  var name: String
}
```

- `FernoChild` is returned, because the API request returns the key from the newly created child.

#### Example

```swift
let newDeveloper = Developer(name: "Elon", favLanguage: "Python", age: 46) // conforms to Content
let newDeveloperKey: FernoChild = try await app.ferno.create("developers", body: newDeveloper)
```

### DELETE

Used to delete an entry in your database

```swift
app.ferno.delete(_ path: [String]) try await -> Bool
```

```swift
app.ferno.delete(_ path: String...) try await -> Bool
```

- the delete method will return a boolean depending on if the delete was successful

#### Example

```swift
let successfulDelete: Bool = try await app.ferno.delete(["developers", "dev-1"])
```

### PATCH

Update values at a specific location, but omitted values won't get removed

```swift
app.ferno.update(_ path: [String], body: T) try await -> T
```

```swift
app.ferno.update(_ path: String..., body: T) try await -> T
```

- the update method will return the body

### Example

```swift
struct UpdateDeveloperName: Content {
  var name: String
}

let newDeveloperName = UpdateDeveloperName(name: "Kimbal") //conforms to Content
let updatedDeveloperName: UpdateDeveloperName = try await app.ferno.update(["developers", newDeveloperKey.name], body: newDeveloper) //newDeveloperKey.name comes from the create method
```

### PUT

Overwrite the current location with data you are passing in

```swift
client.ferno.overwrite(_ path: [String], body: T) try await -> T
```

```swift
client.ferno.overwrite(_ path: String..., body: T) try await -> T
```

#### Example

```swift
struct LeadDeveloper: Content {
  var name: String
  var company: String
  var age: Int
}

let leadDeveloper = LeadDeveloper(name: "Ashley", company: "Bio-Fit", age: 20)
let leadDevResponse: LeadDeveloper = try await app.ferno.overwrite(["developers", newDeveloperKey.name], body: leadDeveloper)
```

## Testing

Currently, tests were written using an actual dummy Firebase realtime database. If you want to run all of the tests, you will need to create a dummy Firebase realtime database.

### Testing Setup

You need to go to `Application+Testing.swift` and fill in the missing values based on your Firebase service account. Then you will be able to run tests.
